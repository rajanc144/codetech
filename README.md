Objective:
The project aimed to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time, improving the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems to prevent financial losses and enhance security.

Scope:

Data Collection: Utilized a publicly available dataset containing transaction records with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
Data Preprocessing: Conducted preprocessing tasks including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. Analyzed class imbalance due to the rarity of fraudulent transactions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to understand the characteristics and distributions of transaction features. Visualized data to identify patterns and correlations using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
Feature Engineering: Developed new features and transformed existing ones to enhance model performance. Applied techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most informative features.
Model Building: Implemented and evaluated various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines. Utilized cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC to ensure effective detection of fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
Outcome:
The developed model successfully identified fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, contributing to reduced financial losses and enhanced security measures. The insights gained from feature importance and model performance metrics also informed future improvements in fraud detection strategies.

This project demonstrated the ability to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem, providing practical experience in data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
